#Assignment4 Komputer Store App
 
## Main
The goal of this assignment was to build a dynamic webpage using "vanilla" javascript. The mission was to create a webpage that made the user work to be able to buy computers from a store app. The page is divided into four different sections. Where the first section is a bank that has control over the user's balance and the user can also take a loan. The second section is a workstation where you earn money that you can bank and if necessary pay back on your loan. The third second contains all the different computers inside a "select" object. These computers are fetched from a web api. It also displays the specs for the selected computer. The last section displays a picture, description, price and title of the selected computer. It also has a buy button so that the user can buy the selected computer, if the balance allows that.
## Project Structure
The project contains a html page, a css file and a javascript file to visualize the store app.
In the html page the whole structure of the page is managed by dividing everything into different divs. In the css the general design for the different html-objects are made, to make the page look more pretty. In the javascript all the functionality is done for the store app.
